-- Consider a table EmployeeAttendance with columns â€“ AttendanceID, EmployeeID, Date, Status. Write a query to find employees with more than 5 absences in a month.
-- This query filters the records for absent status, groups them by EmployeeID and month, and counts absences, filtering for more than 5 absences.
--
SELECT EmployeeID,
 MONTH(Date) AS Month,
 COUNT(*) AS Absences
 FROM EmployeeAttendance
    WHERE Status = 'Absent'
    GROUP BY EmployeeID, MONTH(Date)
